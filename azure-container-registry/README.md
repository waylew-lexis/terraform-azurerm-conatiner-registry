Terraform Accelerator has created mandatory files and sub directories; main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, modules and examples sub directories for you.

Each file contains commented sample code for selected targeted content for each file type (e.g. main.tf contains a sample code block for a module definition).

 

You can use Terraform Accelerator VS Code extension to create code blocks within these generated files. Further you can use any text editor or IDE to modify these files to include terraform code.

 

You can use the Terraform Accelerator VS Code extension or your preferred IDE\text editor to create any additional files or sub directories within the Root Module following the Terraform Standard Module Structure as defined in the official documentation found in https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/modules/develop/structure.html.


Note: Please update the default content to align with the purpose of the blueprint being developed.
